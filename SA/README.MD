# SA
For this part we are going to use 2 approaches:

 - SVM
 - LR

For both approaches I am attaching python files in order to use them. 

In order to run the sample code position yourself at the root of the repo and use ``python SA\SAModels.py``.

## Requirements
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install inspect
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install pickle
pip install joblib
pip install nltk
```
